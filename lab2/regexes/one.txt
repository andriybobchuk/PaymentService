O Lithuania! My homeland! You are as good health,
Only the one who lost you can judge his former wealth,
Today, all your beauty and sublimity I view,
And, seeing it, I depict it, because I yearn for you!

When my mother gave me under Your care crying,
My dead eyelid opened again without dying,
And soon, I could walk to Your templeâ€™s threshold,
To thank God for the life that now I can hold,
Thus, by a miracle, You will bring us home,
Meanwhile, please, bear my yearning soul,
To those woodland hillocks, to those meadows, green and gleaming,

Spread wide along each side of the blue-flowing Niemen,
To those fields with various grain painted,
With wheat gilded, and with rye silvered;
Where the amber mustard, buckwheat white as snow,
Where clover flowers with maidenly blushes grow,
And all as if girded with a ribbon made of green balks,
Upon which, quiet pear trees spread in few flocks.
